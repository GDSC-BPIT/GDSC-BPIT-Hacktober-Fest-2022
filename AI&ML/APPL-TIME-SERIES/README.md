# Dataset used for training

I have provided the dataset along with the code which is in CSV format.

I have also provided the requirements.txt file. You can install it using `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your enviroment.

# LSTM
Long short-term memory is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network can process not only single data points, but also entire sequences of data.
